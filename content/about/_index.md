This is my about page. :wave:

I am a data scientist learning MLOps. This website is a part of the learning process.

With a heavy math background, I came to the world of DS/ML/AI after a fun journey. Funny things that I've done include (but are not limited to):
<br/><br/>
- got a PhD in math that is *essentially useless* for my remaining life,

- ... except I wrote a fiction book (in Chinese) about that journey, which was published.
- learned C, C++, Java, Scala, Python, Rust, and more on my own through various online courses and projects, **purely for fun**.
- self-taught data structures and algorithms and more CS concepts, also for fun, to the point that I can get a few gold medals in their competitions (except I already forgot most of the advanced techniques).
- I got my first job (outside of academia) because my employer back then *mixed up Java and JavaScript*, and thought that I, knowing Java, would be a good fit for their web projects.
- ... this was how I learned JavaScript, various web frameworks, and frontend and backend concepts (such as MVC, Rest API, etc.)
- I enrolled in a big data master program without knowing how to read a CSV file using Python and ended up being the top student of my year in that program,
- ... which landed me data science jobs, which are **fun**.
- Next up: learn MLOps and Cloud (mainly AWS).

I strongly believe that **if I don't stop learning, the fun will continue**.
